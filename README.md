# non_word_generation
This is a small code aimed to generate non-words (non pronunciable sequence of strings) derived from word stimuli, usefull for psycholinguistic experiments.
Notice that it randomize characters and paste it togheter to create a random sequence of letters. Thus, it is possible that the rearrangment generates another word.
A visual check could be useful for that.
